Android Wear Tutorial
=====================

As the name suggest this repository serves as code reference for a set of tutorials on [Android Wear][1].

Starting from a sample application running just on an handheld device, the code evolves to support and to take advantage of wearables devices.

**More about this journey at:**

1. [Introduction to Wearables][2]
2. [Landing on Wearables][3] (debugging, extending notifications)
3. [Colonizing Wearables][4] (running apps on an Android Wear)
4. [Pimp my Wear][5] (custom UIâ€™s)
5. Data exchange and Sync
